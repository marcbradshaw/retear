Description:

ReTear is a multipurpose search/replace utility designed to replace/delete or
show kludges and tearlines in fidonet packets.
Its main uses are removing unwanted Kludge lines, Allowing you to customise
your TearLines and Kludge Lines (eg. PID:) and/or outputting these for stats
generation.

You should create one or more config files to suit your needs, ReTear is best
used from scripts/batch files, included is an ARexx script to ReTear every
packet in a given directory.



Error Codes:

    0       It Worked! ;)
    10      No Config File.
    11      Error opening Source packet.
    12      Error opening Destination packet.
    20      Source packet has invalid header.
    21      Error in source packet.
    22      Source packet is too short.
    30      Error in Config File.
                ** should NEVER happen, errors are reported to
                stdout and error 10 (No Config File) results as
                Config is nullified.
    103     Memory Allocation Error.



Config File Layout:

TYPE Character
List of options
<blank line>
TYPE Character
List of options
<blank line>
E

Types are
    V - View
    R - Replace
    D - Delete
    I - Insert Kludge at start of msg

For Insert ONLY
    first line      - what the thing is (the id string)
    there follows a list of Kludges which will be added in rotation
    to the start of every message.
    If you do not explicitly include the \1 at the start it will be
    added for you, however if you do it will not be added twice, this
    is to stop you breaking messages! :)
    N.B. use multiple 'I' lines for multiple additions from 1.06
    and above please!

The Rest Of The Options are
    first line      - what to look for (the find string)
    second line     - what this is (the id string)
    remaining lines - what to replace this thing with
                        (list of replace strings) for type R only

lines may be in "" chars and contain \1 \" \\ \n \r format strings

if the config file contains errors then ReTear will throw it out! :)



Example config file:

***** begin config file *****
I
ReTear Kludge
\1ReTorn: ReTear 2.0x
\1ReTorn: ReTear - dBnY^nBS
