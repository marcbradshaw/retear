ReTear
======

Found this in an old archive, from way back in 1998 when we thought we were so cool (or was it kewl).
I think this was originally done in Dice C, on the Amiga, but also compiled on some MSDos compiler, I
forget which one.

Totally fails to compile with gcc, and I have no inclination to fix it, just throwing it up on github as
a curiosity.

It was used to search/replace kludges and tag lines inside fidonet packets.

The contact details in the source are of course long since invalid.
